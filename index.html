        <u><b>Energy Generation</b></u> </p><br>
        <p>

Total net energy generation in FY 2019-20 was 71,419 GWh,
which was about 1.26% higher than previous year’s net
generation of 70,533 GWh. Net energy generation in the
public sector was 35,316 GWh and 29,429 GWh in the
private sector (including REB). Another 6,674 GWh was
imported from India through the interconnection in
Bheramara and Tripura.<br>
Total net energy generated in public and private sector
power plants by type of fuel are as follows:<br>

<u><b>Plant Efficiency and Maintenance</b></u> <br>
The overall Thermal efficiency (Net) of the public-sector power plants in FY 2019-20 was 39.72%. Previous year’s
it was 38.4%.
</p>  <br><br>
<p>Below the list of major power plants were under maintenance in the FY 2019-20:</p>

<u><b>Transmission</b></u> <br>

<p>During fiscal year 2019-20, very significant transmission components have been
added to the system because of the completion of different project works. Ttransmission line
length (ckt. km) has enlarged by 5.15% than that of previous year. The line details are as below:</p>

<p>Total length of 400 KV transmission line
increased to 861 circuit km from the previous
year 697.76 circuit km. The total length of 230
kV transmission line increased to 3658
circuit km from the previous year of
3406.69 circuit km. The total length of
132 kV transmission line increased to
7,764 circuit km from the previous
year of 7545.5 circuit km.</p>

<u><b>Power Sector Development Plan</b></u> <br></p>
   
<p>Electricity plays the most basic role in the economic growth through sustainable structure as well as poverty eradication and security of any S R, country. Reliable electricity supply is a vital issue for the world today. Future economic growth crucially depends on the long-term availability of electricity, e which are affordable, available and environmentally friendly. Security, climate change, and public health are closely interrelated with electricity. In line with this aspect, Bangladesh Government designed an extensive power generation plan to create sustainable growth of power sector and for overall development of the country economy.</p>
<br>
<p>Present installed generation capacity in public, private, Joint venture & import sector is 20,383 MW. Out of this, public sector possesses 9,717 MW (48%), Private Sector 8,884 MW (43%), Joint Venture 622 MW( 3%) & import 1,160MW (6%). Electricity demand is increasing whereas the available generation also increases against with demand. In the public sector, a number of generation units have become very old and has been operating at a reduced capacity. Moreover, most of the existing power plants are gas based. Due to shortage of gas supply, some power plants are unable to reach their usual generation capability. In this fiscal year maximum generation is 12,738 MW on August 05, 2019. At present, 97% of the total population has access to electricity and per capita generation is 512 kWh (including captive and renewable energy). Now Bangladesh has shown implausible achievement in power sector. The target of the government has been implemented successfully and has even been able to achieve the higher level of growth economic growth.
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
 <p style="align-content: center;">
<u><b>Long Term Power Generation Plan</b></u> <br></p>
<br>
<p> A long-term electricity generation plan has been incorporated in the PSMP 2016. Under the plan, generation capacity requirement in 2030 will be 30,000 MW against the demand of 27,000 MW and in 2041 generation capacity will be 57,000 MW against the demand of 51,000 MW. Around 35 % power will be generated from coal and 35 % will be generated from Gas /LNG out of the total generaion capacity 57,000 MW in 2041.</p>
<br><br><br>
<p style="align-content: center;">
<u><b>Implementation Status of Power Generation Plan upto 2025</b></u> <br></p>
<br>
<p>
 Till now, generation from gas is much higher than compare to other fuel like hydro, coal. For this reason, government has taken strategic decision to diversify primary fuel supply for power generation. In line with this strategy, a sustainable long-term power development plan has been prepared for mitigation the growing demand to reach the generation capacity 24,000 MW by 2021. Under this plan, the coal (indigenous or imported), imported power from neighboring countries, the limited domestic gas, nuclear power and LNG, renewable will be used for power generation. Government has also taken energy efficiency and conservation program for reduction of the growing power demand.Revised generation expansion plan updated in January 2020 targeting about 21,977 MW generation
additions from 2020 to 2025 is provided in a table below:
